Looking for Ph.D. Students
======
I am ALWAYS looking for self-motivated students with:
* Relevant research experience (e.g. publications on decent conf/trans)
* Solid GPA records (e.g. top 15% in your major or department)
* Solid programming skills (e.g. hands on experience in Python/C/C++)
* Big plus if familiar with Deep Learning tools (e.g. Pytorch/Tensorflow/Caffe)
* Most important, strong motivation for a Ph.D. degree

Please feel free to contact me with your CV, Transcripts, and Publications (if applicable).

Research
======
My research focuses on Structural, Model-Oriented Deep Learning. The goal is to answer the following questions:
* Can we learn AI systems promptly and adequately when only limited or skewed data are available? (Efficient)
* Can AI system make robust and safe decisions when training and testing data follow different distributions? (Robust)
* Can we extend from curve-fitting to model causal inference between data and environment? (Explainable)

I am enthusiastic in extending my research to advanced frontier solutions for cross-disciplinary data analytics. Specially, I am making efforts to develop frontier AI solutions for biomechanics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, psychology, and linguistics .
