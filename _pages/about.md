This is a mini page of [My Full Homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/xipengcshomepage/). You can get more information of me by [**Publications**](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/files/PUBLICATION.pdf) and [**CV**](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/files/CV.pdf). My research focuses on **Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision**.

I am a tenure-track faculty at University of Delaware:
- **Assistant Professor**, [Computer & Info Sciences](https://www.cis.udel.edu/), [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/)
- **Resident Faculty**, [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.udel.edu/), [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/)
- **Visiting Professor**, [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/), [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/)

My reserach training background: 
- Ph.D. in Computer Science, [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/), 2018
- M.S. in Computer Science, [Automation Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), 2011
- B.E. in Automation Science, [Beihang University](http://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2008.


Looking for Ph.D. Students
======
Fully supported Ph.D. positions are available at University of Delaware. I am **ALWAYS** looking for self-motivated students if you have following merits. Please feel free to contact me with your CV, Transcripts, and Publications (if applicable).

- Relevant **research** experience (e.g. publications on decent conf/trans)
- Solid **GPA** records (e.g. top 15% in your major or department)
- Solid **programming** skills (e.g. hands on experience in Python/C/C++)
- Big plus if familiar with Deep Learning tools (e.g. Pytorch/Tensorflow/Caffe)
- Most important, strong motivation for a Ph.D. degree


Research
======
I am learning **Deep-REAL**: [Deep Robust and Explainable AI Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/xipengcshomepage/research) at University of Delaware. My research focuses on **Structural, Model-Oriented Deep Learning**. The goal is to answer the following questions:

- Can we learn AI systems promptly and adequately when only limited or skewed data are available? (**Efficient**)
- Can AI system make robust and safe decisions when training and testing data follow different distributions? (**Robust**)
- Can we extend from curve-fitting to model causal inference between data and environment? (**Explainable**)

I am enthusiastic in extending my research to advanced frontier solutions for cross-disciplinary data analytics. Specially, I am making efforts to develop frontier AI solutions for biomechanics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, psychology, and linguistics .
