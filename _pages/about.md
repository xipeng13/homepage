I joined [the department of computer science](https://www.binghamton.edu/computer-science/index.html) at [Binghamton University - State University of New York](https://www.binghamton.edu/) in 2018. My new position is tenure-track assistant professor. I am also a visiting professor in [department of computer science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey](https://www.rutgers.edu/).

I obtained the Ph.D. degree from [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) (2012-2017), the Master degree from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/) (2008-2011), and the Bachelor degree from [Beihang University](http://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/) (2004-2008). I enjoyed two research internships in [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com/) (2016 summer) and [IBM T.J. Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/) (2015 summer/fall). I also spent a wonderful year as a full-time engineer in [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) (2011-2012).

My research intends to explore the frontier of [Efficient & General & Robust AI]. Research areas include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I have more than 30 publications in a range of top-ranked journals (TPAMI, IJCV, TIP, etc), conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IJCAI, etc), and patents.
