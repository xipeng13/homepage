This is a mini homepage in case you can't access [My Full Google Site](https://sites.google.com/site/xipengcshomepage/).
- A full list of my [**Publications**](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/files/PUBLICATION.pdf)
- A detailed [**CV**](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/files/CV.pdf)

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.binghamton.edu/computer-science/index.html) at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/). I am also a Visiting Professor in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/).

I obtained Ph.D. degree from [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) (2012-2017), M.S. degree from [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/) (2008-2011), and B.S. degree from [Beihang University](http://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/) (2004-2008).

I enjoyed two research internships in [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com/) (2016) and [IBM T.J. Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/) (2015). I also spent a wonderful year as a full-time engineer in [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) (2011-2012).

My research intends to explore the frontier of [Efficient & General & Robust AI](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/). Research areas include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I have >30 publications in a range of top-ranked journals (_TPAMI, IJCV, TIP, etc_), conferences (_CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IJCAI, etc_), and patents. 

I started to co-advise multiple [Ph.D. students](https://sites.google.com/site/xipengcshomepage/student) at Rutgers since 2017. Most students published their first top conference papers within one year.
