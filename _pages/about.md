This is a mini homepage of [My Full Google Site](https://sites.google.com/site/xipengcshomepage/). You can get more information of me by [**Publications**](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/files/PUBLICATION.pdf) and [**CV**](https://xipeng13.github.io/homepage/files/CV.pdf)

I am a tenure-track faculty at University of Delaware:
- **Assistant Professor**, [Computer & Info Sciences](https://www.cis.udel.edu/), [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/)
- **Resident Faculty**, [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.udel.edu/), [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/)
- **Visiting Professor**, [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/), [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/)

I was awarded Ph.D. degree from [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) in 2018, M.S. degree from [Automation Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/) in 2011, and B.S. degree from [Beihang University](http://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2008.

Looking for Ph.D. Students
======
I am ALWAYS looking for self-motivated students with:
- Relevant research experience (e.g. publications on decent conf/trans)
- Solid GPA records (e.g. top 15% in your major or department)
- Solid programming skills (e.g. hands on experience in Python/C/C++)
- Big plus if familiar with Deep Learning tools (e.g. Pytorch/Tensorflow/Caffe)
- Most important, strong motivation for a Ph.D. degree

Please feel free to contact me with your CV, Transcripts, and Publications (if applicable).

Research
======
My research focuses on Structural, Model-Oriented Deep Learning. The goal is to answer the following questions:
- Can we learn AI systems promptly and adequately when only limited or skewed data are available? (Efficient)
- Can AI system make robust and safe decisions when training and testing data follow different distributions? (Robust)
- Can we extend from curve-fitting to model causal inference between data and environment? (Explainable)

I am enthusiastic in extending my research to advanced frontier solutions for cross-disciplinary data analytics. Specially, I am making efforts to develop frontier AI solutions for biomechanics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, psychology, and linguistics .
